"""Very small stub of the :mod:`PIL` module used in tests.

The real project depends on Pillow to read and write images.  Shipping the
entire dependency would make the exercises considerably heavier, therefore a
tiny in-house stub is provided.  It implements just enough features for the
unit tests:

* ``Image.new`` creates an in-memory image object.
* ``Image.open`` loads the raw bytes of a file.
* ``Image.save`` writes those bytes back to disk.
* ``convert`` is a no-op returning ``self``.

The stub stores opaque byte strings instead of real image data â€“ the tests only
verify file existence, not image contents.
